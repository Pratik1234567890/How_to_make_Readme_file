# How_to_make_Readme_file
  ## How to craft a useful,well-written README
A strong H1 title and an H2 subtitle- just like writing an article or a blog post, you need a great title and subtitle to sttarct search engines and human. It doesn't need to be the name of the projects ,but it does help if your title includes the name of the projects.
## Intro Paragraph
An intro Paragraph focused on that the project does- write an intro paragraph about what this projects is , what it does, and how it's used this is still for SEO purposes and for keeping it smile about the value your projects provides to the user who is searching for it.
## Diagram(Optional)
If necessary add a diagram showing where this project fits and how it works.If it's a ClI tool or a graphical tool ,this would be great opportunity to add an animated GIF of your project in action.
even better ,adding a youtube video demo of your project to your README could be very beneficial to gaining more users.
##  Installation and usage instructions(for contributors)
you know the best part of open source projects? if you make something really cool ,other will want to help it better ! in this section of README,give instruction on how to pull the code down and start up the tool for developemt purposes.This sections is usually pretty technical and may reqire instruction on how to build from source but hopefully you have a script for MAKEFILe from stuff like that.Any thing you can do to make the development experience easier will help you gain more contributors.
## contributor expectations
If you are looking for contributors make sure you set the ground rules.There is nothing worse than getting someone who wants to help you but thet dont know how This section of the README gives the guidelines for contributions. Do you expect someone to create an issue in the issue queue and then resolve it with a pull request? Do you want squashed commits? Do you have a pull requests template? Explain it all here.
